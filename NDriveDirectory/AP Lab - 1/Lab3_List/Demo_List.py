# List is a mutable datatype...
# Mutable means editable..
# Integer, Float, Strings were immutable
# List supports many build-in features/functions
# Python supports +ve & -ve indexing (both)

b = [1,2,3.14,9.8,'juet',10]
# sliceing requires 2 values
# first values = starting index
# second value = ending value
# example :-
a[1:3] #starting index is included in the list bt ending index is not included
#in indexing, relaionsship works if th3e4 index is in incremental order
#to retreive elements from iterables, python has specific purpose loop knowo as iterables.
