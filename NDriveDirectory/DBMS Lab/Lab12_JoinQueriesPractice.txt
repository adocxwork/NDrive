### 1) Retrieve the full name of employees and the name of the department they work in:

    e.Lname AS Last_Name, 
    d.Dname AS Department_Name
FROM 
    EMPLOYEE e
JOIN 
    DEPARTMENT d ON e.Dno = d.Dnumber;


### 2) List all employees who work on projects managed by the 'Research' department, showing the employee's full name and project name:

SELECT 
    e.Fname AS First_Name, 
    e.Lname AS Last_Name, 
    p.Pname AS Project_Name
FROM 
    EMPLOYEE e
JOIN 
    WORKS_ON w ON e.Ssn = w.Essn
JOIN 
    PROJECT p ON w.Pno = p.Pnumber
JOIN 
    DEPARTMENT d ON p.Dnum = d.Dnumber
WHERE 
    d.Dname = 'Research';


### 3) Find the total hours worked by each employee on all projects combined:

SELECT 
    e.Fname AS First_Name, 
    e.Lname AS Last_Name, 
    SUM(w.Hours) AS Total_Hours
FROM 
    EMPLOYEE e
JOIN 
    WORKS_ON w ON e.Ssn = w.Essn
GROUP BY 
    e.Fname, e.Lname;


### 4) Show the project names and the names of employees who work on them, ordered by project name:

SELECT 
    p.Pname AS Project_Name, 
    e.Fname AS First_Name, 
    e.Lname AS Last_Name
FROM 
    PROJECT p
JOIN 
    WORKS_ON w ON p.Pnumber = w.Pno
JOIN 
    EMPLOYEE e ON w.Essn = e.Ssn
ORDER BY 
    p.Pname;


### 5) Display the department name along with the total number of employees working in each department:
SELECT 
    d.Dname AS Department_Name, 
    COUNT(e.Ssn) AS Total_Employees
FROM 
    DEPARTMENT d
LEFT JOIN 
    EMPLOYEE e ON d.Dnumber = e.Dno
GROUP BY 
    d.Dname;
