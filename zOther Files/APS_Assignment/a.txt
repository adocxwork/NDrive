### **1. Personal Software Process (PSP) and Team Software Process (TSP)**  

#### **a. Objectives**  
- **PSP:**  
  - Helps individual developers improve their productivity and quality of work.  
  - Focuses on defect prevention, estimation accuracy, and personal responsibility.  
  - Encourages continuous self-improvement through data collection and analysis.  

- **TSP:**  
  - Extends PSP principles to teams for better project coordination.  
  - Ensures structured planning, schedule management, and quality tracking.  
  - Promotes teamwork, role assignment, and process discipline for successful project execution.  

#### **b. Framework Activities**  
- **PSP Framework Activities:**  
  1. **Planning:** Estimate time, effort, and project size.  
  2. **Design & Code Reviews:** Identify and fix defects early.  
  3. **Development:** Implement code while tracking time and defects.  
  4. **Testing:** Perform unit tests and analyze defect sources.  
  5. **Postmortem Analysis:** Review performance and improve future processes.  

- **TSP Framework Activities:**  
  1. **Team Formation & Planning:** Define roles, objectives, and work breakdown.  
  2. **Development & Quality Assurance:** Follow structured iterations, with team reviews.  
  3. **Monitoring & Tracking:** Collect project metrics and adjust accordingly.  
  4. **Postmortem & Process Refinement:** Conduct retrospectives to improve team efficiency.  

#### **c. Examples**  
- **PSP Example:** A developer working on a new feature estimates development time, tracks defect origins, and refines their process after analyzing results.  
- **TSP Example:** A software team collaborates on a project, conducts regular reviews, and refines development strategies based on past performance.

### **2. Process Models**  

#### **a. Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD)**  
- **Concept:**  
  - Aims to improve modularity by separating cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security, error handling) from core business logic.  
  - Enhances maintainability by allowing independent development of aspects and core logic.  

- **Diagram Representation:**  
  - Various concerns (logging, security, error handling) are separately defined and then "woven" into the core application dynamically.  

#### **b. Adaptive Software Development (ASD)**  
- **Concept:**  
  - Designed for projects with highly dynamic requirements.  
  - Uses a continuous cycle of **Speculate → Collaborate → Learn** to refine development.  
  - Emphasizes rapid learning, flexibility, and customer involvement.  

- **Key Phases:**  
  1. **Speculate:** Initial planning based on current assumptions.  
  2. **Collaborate:** Active teamwork and user feedback integration.  
  3. **Learn:** Review progress, adapt strategies, and refine future development.  

#### **c. Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**  
- **Concept:**  
  - An agile framework focused on delivering business-driven solutions efficiently.  
  - Prioritizes active user involvement, iterative development, and frequent product releases.  

- **Phases:**  
  1. **Pre-Project:** Define scope and business objectives.  
  2. **Feasibility Study:** Assess technical and financial viability.  
  3. **Business Study:** Gather detailed requirements.  
  4. **Iterative Development:** Implement features incrementally.  
  5. **Deployment:** Deliver functional software to users.  
  6. **Post-Project:** Evaluate project success and document lessons learned.  

These process models provide structured approaches for handling software development challenges while ensuring flexibility and quality.### **1. Personal Software Process (PSP) and Team Software Process (TSP)**
